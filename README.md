The goal of this program is to populate a 2d matrix with suedo random numbers and respond to user input manipulation. The user can navage the 2d matrix by selecting a row and column, then subract a desired number from that column, adding it to the total. If the user input is greater than the number in the column, only the number in the column is added to the total and a 0 is placed in the matrix at the chosen location.
